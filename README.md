# spotify-kaggle Challenge

This challenge from Kaggle was uploaded by my Professor to launch an internal competition in my university ESILV.

The data is about Spotify users and whether they like or not a set of songs.

Thanks to many features, I had to determine the user binary appreciation.

After the final submission, I reach the 78% of accuracy.
